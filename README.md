### About this project

Our second project at the Wild Code School. We now have to use React to create a responsive website. Our data must be fetched from APIs from our choice. We decided to create a website about the critical situation of the earth. We created our website based on the idea that we have 3 years left before it's too late. We read the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC and we decided that we have to do something about it.

### APIs and Data

We fetched data from https://global-warming.org/

### Deployment

The website has been deployed on Netlify : https://3arthkeeper.netlify.app/
